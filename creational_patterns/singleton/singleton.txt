The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and 
provides a global point of access to that instance. It is commonly used when you want to have a 
single instance of a class that controls some resource, manages a shared resource, or coordinates 
actions within a system.

Key Features of the Singleton Pattern:

    Private Constructor: The class should have a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation 
    from other classes.

    Private Static Instance: The class should have a private static instance variable that holds the 
    single instance of the class.

    Public Static Method: The class should provide a public static method that allows clients to access 
    the instance. This method ensures that only one instance is created and returned.


Here are some scenarios where you might consider using the Singleton pattern:

    Resource Management: If you have a limited resource, such as a database connection pool, a thread pool, 
    or a configuration manager, you can use the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance manages 
    and provides access to these resources. This helps prevent resource exhaustion and ensures efficient utilization.

    Logging: When you want to centralize logging functionality to ensure consistent and controlled logging across your 
    application.

    Database Access: If you have a class that interacts with a database, you might want to use a Singleton to manage 
    the connection and ensure that there's only one connection instance throughout the application's lifecycle.

    Global Configuration: For managing application-wide configurations or settings, a Singleton can ensure that 
    there's a single point of access and modification.

    Thread Pools: In multithreaded applications, a Singleton can be used to manage a thread pool, controlling the 
    number of threads available for concurrent tasks.

    Factory Pattern with Single Instance: When you have a factory class that produces objects, and you want to ensure 
    that there's only one instance of that factory, you can implement the factory as a Singleton.


It's important to use the Singleton pattern judiciously, as it introduces a global state to your application, which can 
sometimes lead to tight coupling and hinder testability. Additionally, be cautious with multithreaded environments, as 
the basic Singleton implementation is not inherently thread-safe. 

In general, use the Singleton pattern when you need to control and restrict the instantiation of a class to a single instance 
and ensure that this instance is globally accessible throughout your application.
