Refactoring should be done as a series of small changes, each of which makes the existing code 
slightly better while still leaving the program in working order.

The code should become cleaner.
    If the code remains just as unclean after refactoring... well, you’ve just wasted an hour of your 
    life. Try to figure out why this happened.

New functionality shouldn’t be created during refactoring.
    Don’t mix refactoring and direct development of new features. Try to separate these processes 
    at least within the confines of individual commits.

All existing tests must pass after refactoring.
